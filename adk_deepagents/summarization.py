"""Conversation summarization — context window management.

Placeholder for Phase 5 implementation. Will provide token counting,
message partitioning, and summary generation to prevent context window
overflow during long conversations.
"""

from __future__ import annotations

from adk_deepagents.types import SummarizationConfig

# Will be implemented in Phase 5 with:
# - Token counting (approximate or model-specific)
# - Message partitioning (keep recent, summarize old)
# - Summary generation via lightweight model call
# - History offloading to backend
