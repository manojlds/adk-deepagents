# Blog Writing Skill

## Structure
Every blog post should follow this structure:

1. **Title** — Compelling, includes primary keyword, under 60 characters
2. **Introduction** — Hook the reader, state the problem, preview the solution
3. **Body** — 3-5 sections with H2 headers, each covering a key point
4. **Conclusion** — Summarize key takeaways, include a call to action

## SEO Guidelines
- Include the primary keyword in the title, first paragraph, and at least 2 headers
- Use related keywords naturally throughout the content
- Write meta description (150-160 characters)
- Aim for 1,000-2,000 words for comprehensive posts

## Formatting
- Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- Include bullet points and numbered lists
- Add code blocks for technical content
- Bold key phrases for scannability

## Output Format
Save blog posts as Markdown files with this naming convention:
`/output/blog-{slug}.md`
